Description: Methods to generate a design in the input space that sequentially fills the output space of a black-box function. The output space-filling designs are helpful in inverse design or feature-based modeling problems. 
             See Wang, Shangkun, Adam P. Generale, Surya R. Kalidindi, and V. Roshan Joseph. (2024), Sequential designs for filling output spaces, Technometrics, 66, 65â€“76. for details. This work is supported by U.S. National Foundation grant CMMI-1921646.
